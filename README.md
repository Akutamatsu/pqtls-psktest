- Christian Paquin, Douglas Stebila, and Goutam Tamvada. **Benchmarking post-quantum cryptography in TLS**. *IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive*, Report 2019/1447. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1447](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1447).

It contains code and associated data for benchmarking post-quantum cryptography in TLS 1.3. The `emulation_exp` and `internet_exp` folders contain code and data related to the emulated and internet experiments, respectively.
